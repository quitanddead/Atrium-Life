Civilian:<br/>
#1: Stats<br/>
here is where you will find a great deal of useful information.  Anything from how much money you
are carrying to who has a bounty and how much that bounty may be.<br/>
#2: Inventory:<br/>
-this will tell you what you are carrying and also provides an interface to use some of those
items in your inventory.  For example, if your getting the message, ""You Are Starving"" and you
have 10 fish in your inventory.  Press the #2, highlight ""fish"", change the number in the box
to ""10"", then click ""use"".  That will make your character eat the fish and you will loose
some hunger (high hunger is a bad thing).  You may also notice ""key chain"" in your inventory.
This will hold all your keys to the vehicles you own.  You can give these keys to other players
via this interface but know that they need to be near you for something like 5 seconds to receive
the item.<br/>
#3: Hands Up<br/>
This button will make your character put his hands up.  This is useful for when you want to show
the coppers that you are not a threat and are cooperating.  They can then restrain you if they
feel the need.
<br/>
#4: Hands Down<br/>
this button will return you to a normal pos from ""hands up"".
<br/>
E: Action<br/>
this button is your basic ""action button"".  this is how you will interact with the various
interfaces around Chern such as shops and ATM's.  This will also allow you to attempt to steal
from other players.  You can only steal money if the other player has been knocked unconscious or
is restrained.
<br/>
T: Access Inventory<br/>
when you own a car or other vehicle, you can access that car's inventory by sitting in the drivers seat
 and pressing ""T"".  You will then be shown two box's.  The left box is what is in the car,
and the right box is what is in your inventory.  Highlight the object you want to transfer, then
select the amount and press the button on the side that has the item.  Car's hold a certain
amount of weight just like your character so be aware of what you stash in there.  Also, if your
vehicle is destroyed then you will loose whatever you place in here.  Coppers can search for
drugs or other illegal items.  If they find them in your car it will disappear and the coppers
gain money equal to the value of the drugs.
<br/>
left shift+F: Stun<br/>
If you have a gun in your hands, you can stand next to another player and perform a stun action.
Be aware that this will knock all of the other players weapons out onto the ground, so if you
don't want to piss everyone off, only do this to your enemies.
<br/>
0-0-6, 0-0-7, 0-0-8: shout outs<br/>
Press these buttons to shout out messages on the fly.  For civilians the default says ""Don't
Shoot, I surrender!"".  For cops, it says a variety of things but mainly says, ""Put up your
hands or your dead"" kinda thing.
<br/>
0-0: options<br/>
this should give you the options for video settings, shout outs, fix head bug, and even a quick-
brief tutorial on CLR.""
<br/>
Cops:<br/>
`(tilde key (to the left of the 1 key): COPMENU. allows you to set their bounties, set them free
and more. you have more options if you use the copmenu whilst in a vehicle.
